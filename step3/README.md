# Step 3: Verification

In this step, we verify that the credentials have been correctly extracted and are ready for use.

## Run it

Run the following command to view the credentials:

```bash
./run.sh
```

## Output

You should see output similar to:

```text
Role ID: xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
Secret ID: xxxxx***** (Hidden)
Credentials are ready for use.
```

The Secret ID is partially hidden for security reasons.

## Next Step

Now that we have the keys, let's start the car! Go to [Step 4](../step4/README.md).
